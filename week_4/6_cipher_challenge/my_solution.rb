# U2.W4: Cipher Challenge


# I worked on this challenge with: Jeffrey Kynaston.

# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing. 
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

# .rotate could be used for the cipher; Tried adding 4 to a character in IRB, won't work
# If we need to have a data source with the cipher in it, then using a hash would be faster than using an array
# but, an array would be more malleable 
  input.each do |x| # What is #each doing here?
# each is iterating over each letter in the input array
    found_match = false  # Why would this be assigned to false from the outset? What happens when it's true?
# found match is leaving a catch-all for any characters not found in the conditionals
# if found match is false, then it shovels the coded character into the decoded message directly
    cipher.each_key do |y| # What is #each_key doing here?
# each_key is iterating over each key in the hash
      if x == y  # What is this comparing? Where is it getting x? Where is it getting y? What are those variables really?
# this is comparing if the character from the coded message (x) is equal to the character in the key of the hash (y)
